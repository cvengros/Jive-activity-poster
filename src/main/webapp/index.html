                    Before your can start sending posts, this server has to know about Jive instance and the user to post to.
                    There are two ways to accomplish this:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Your app had set the 'href' of link module pref to this server to listen to install lifecycle event.</li>
                        <li>Your app has sent a 'signed' request to this server.</li>
                    </ol><br>
                    If you are ready to post click <a href="post.html">here</a>.
